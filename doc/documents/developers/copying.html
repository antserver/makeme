        <h1>Copy Files</h1>
        <p>You can copy files at build time by using a copy target which specifies a set of input files and an output
        destination. The copy target has a type property set to 'file'. For example:</p>
<pre class="ui code segment">
setup: {
    type: 'file',
    path: '${CFG}/web',
    files: [ 'web/readme.html' ],
},
</pre>
        <p>This example will copy the specified readme file to the web directory under the platform output
        directory.</p>
        <p>If the destination <em>path</em> property is a directory, the specified files will be copied into that directory.
            If the destination path has a trailing "/", it will be assumed to be a directory and will be created if it does
            not exist.</p>
        <a name="files"></a>
        <p>The <em>files</em> property is an array of files or directories.  These files can include wild cards which are
        expanded using the Ejscript <a href="https://embedthis.com/ejs/doc/api/ejscript/Path.html#files">Path.files</a> 
        routine. The supported wild cards are:
        <ul>
            <li>? &mdash; matches any single character</li>
            <li>* &mdash;  matches zero or more characters in a filename or directory</li>
            <li>** &mdash; zero or more files or directories and matches recursively in a directory tree</li>
            <li>/ &mdash; If a pattern terminates with / it will only match directories.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If an item in the files property is a directory, then the directory and all the files in that directory will be
        copied. In other words, the item will automatically be converted to <em>path/**</em>. If the item has a trailing "/"
        then the contents of the directory will be copied and not the directory itself.</p>
        <p>If the destination path if up-to-date, meaning that no other target that depends on this target is more current, 
            then the files will not be copied.</p>
