            <h1>Contributors Agreement</h1>
            <p>This Contributors Agreement is designed to ensure that <strong>you</strong> are protected and that your
            patches can be utilized by <b>everyone</b>. All submitted patches that are included in Bit are
            governed by this agreement.</p>
            <p>We have based this agreement on the MIT Open Source License which is approved by the Open Source
            Initiative (OSI). It is simple, clear and allows the use of your contributions in Bit under both the
            GPL and commercial licenses. You keep the copyright for your modifications, but everyone gets to enjoy the
            benefit of your contribution. We have made two changes to the MIT license for our use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>We have removed the copyright reference to MIT.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>We have added a statement that submitted code will only be used in commercial products if it
                    also made available in the open source Bit versions.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We <strong>cannot</strong> accept patches that are not licensed under the Contributors Agreement. NOTE:
            we cannot accept patches under a GPL license as this prevents us providing them to some commercial
            customers.</p>
